Assignment 1
Image Filtering and Hybrid Images

Notes to instructor:

- In the source the "sections" are indented an extra 4 spaces because my editor supports folding and this makes it easier to navigate through logical sections of code.
- I have a high resolution monitor so I don't bother with a max column length (sorry)
- test.sh in the code folder will compile and run the tests (after `cmake .` has been ran)
- This was developed and tested on:
  - Ubuntu 15.10 x64
  - cmake 3.2.2
  - make 4.0
  - g++ 5.2.1
  - OpenCV 3.1
